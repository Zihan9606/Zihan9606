<p>I will keeplearning JS while using this blog as an notebook.</p>
<p> The offcial example theme of Github said whenever we commit our <span title="As I know, most of good notbook apps often using Markdown">Markdown</span> type notebook to the repository,
 GitHub Pages will run <span title="(https://jekyllrb.com/)">[Jekyll]</span> to rebuild the pages from the content in Markdown files.But seems like
 it doesn't work and need to be solved.Two more things are mouse changing and audio auto display.

<title>Folling thins are some kinds of testing</title>
<p> 这是关于meta charset="utf-8"的中文输入测试&背景透明化字体随之透明化待解决</p>

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Zihan9606/Zihan9606/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
